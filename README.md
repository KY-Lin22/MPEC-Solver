# MPEC Solver

## Introduction

This repository holds the Matlab implementation of some self-written MPEC solvers. The **NIPMPEC_CasADi** is an general MPEC implementation of my previous research which is dedicated to the continuous time optimal control problem:  

1. Kangyu Lin and Toshiyuki Ohtsuka, "A Non-Interior-Point Continuation Method for the Optimal Control Problem with Equilibrium Constraints, " <https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10336>, 2022, (under review)

and the others are the literature reproduction based on:

1. A.F.Izmailov et al. Combining stabilized SQP with the augmented Lagrangian algorithm, 2015
2. P.E. Gill et al. A stabilized SQP method: superlinear convergence, 2017

## Requirements

- MATLAB 2019b or later
- CasADi
